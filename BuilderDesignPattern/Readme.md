<h2>Builder design pattern</h2>
This solution is about Builder design pattern.
In the following example we have implemented an example about Factory design pattern. It will be considered all classes and interfaces
to extend our example since we are going to design a Builder design pattern. 

<h3>Builder Vs Factory and Abstract Factory</h3>

- Builder design pattern encapsulates complex creation into a single method. 

- Builder design pattern focuses on construction of object in a step by step manner whereas Abstract factory pattern is used to solve problems related to the creation of families of products.

- Builder design pattern returns the object after step by step construction of the complex object where as in Abstract factory or Factory pattern, we return the created product immediately.

- To conclude, many application designs start out using Factory which is less complex and evolve towards Abstract Factory and Builder as the complexity increases with a demand of flexibility.
